\paragraph{\bf Emojis Captures Approximate Meaning} 
One of the successful cases of our visualization is a cluster with the spacecraft emoji ðŸš€ annotated. This cluster contains transportation-related words such as ``c-130'' and ``refueling''. 

On the other hand, some emojis (e.g., Leo emoji) are harder to interpret what does a cluster mean. 
Furthermore, one emoji could have multiple descriptions (e.g., the descriptions for the leo emoji are ``greek'', ``sign'', ``zodiac'', ``stars'', ``constellation'', ``astrology'', ``lion'') which further requires sophisticated processing when we want to improve the quality of the visualization. 

\paragraph{\bf We cannot avoid clutters when data points become large ($>5000$)} 
In this project, we only made the drill available by one level. 
Therefore, even assigning 100 words per cluster would cause visualization clutter.
