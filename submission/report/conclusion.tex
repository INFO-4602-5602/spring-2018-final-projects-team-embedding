\section{Conclusion}
In this project, we used the combination of clustering and annotating those with emojis to relax the problem of visual cluttering and summarizing the visualization. 
The future work is to further use hierarchical clustering to enable multiple levels of drill down to resolve visual clutters when the number of data points become larger.
